I have been using <a href="http://redcareditor.com/">Redcar</a> this morning after hearing about it on the Ruby5 <a href="http://ruby5.envylabs.com/episodes/96-episode-94-july-16-2010/stories/810-this-episode-is-sponsored-by-newrelic-rpm">podcast</a>.<br /><br />I am pretty impressed so far. It has good support for Textmate bundles and works cross-platform. This was an important detail for me since I use OSX at home and Linux at work and it would be nice to use the same editor everywhere. I also like the fact that my editor is written in Ruby and is <a href="http://github.com/danlucraft/redcar">open source</a>.<br /><br />Using <a href="http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/">rvm</a>, I was able to set it up pretty easily:<br />
{% highlight bash %}
rvm install jruby
rvm use jruby
gem install redcar
{% endhighlight %}
<br /><br />And then since I don't usually use jruby, I set up a quick bash function to call it:<br />
{% highlight bash %}
function rc() {
  rvm jruby -S ~/.rvm/gems/jruby-1.5.1/bin/redcar $@ 1> /dev/null 2>&1 &
}
{% endhighlight %}
<br /><br />From there I can just call <code>rc [dir]</code> from the command line and it opens the project.<br /><br />I did have one small issue with installing the ruby-shoulda bundle. The wiki says that if you put bundles in <code>&nbsp;~/.redcar/textmate/Bundles</code> and delete the cache, then they should show up. However, I wasn't able to get it to work unless I put in in the system bundle directory at: <code>&nbsp;~/.rvm/gems/jruby-1.5.1/gems/redcar-0.3.8.1/textmate/Bundles</code><br /><br />I am pretty excited where they can take this project, and possibly even contribute to it in the future.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7616842831210003750-3772977028523750809?l=random-rails.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
