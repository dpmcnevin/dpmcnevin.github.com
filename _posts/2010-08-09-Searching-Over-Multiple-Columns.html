I am developing an application where I collect system information from various hosts within our network and need to search those hosts. I would like to be able to search across multiple columns using 'or' but then return what matched.<br /><br />The setup is pretty simple, I have a Host model that has_one OperatingSystem<br /><br />
{% highlight ruby %}
class Host < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_one :operating_system
  attr_accessor :matched_on
end
{% endhighlight %}
<br /><br />For each model, I implement a 'search' class method, and for the OperatingSystem model, I implemented it as such:<br /><br />
{% highlight ruby %}
class OperatingSystem < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :host

  def self.search(term)
    t = OperatingSystem.arel_table

    match_on = [:name,:version,:service_pack]

    matches = match_on.map {|m| "IF(#{t[m].matches("%#{term}%").to_sql},operating_systems.#{m.to_s},NULL)" }
    matching_string = "CONCAT_WS(' ', #{matches.join(",")}) as matched_on"
 
    results = OperatingSystem.select(
      "*",
      matching_string
    ).having("matched_on != ''").joins(:host)

    results.map do |os|
      host = os.host
      host.matched_on ||= []
      host.matched_on << os.matched_on
      host
    end
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}
<br /><br />What this does is construct a query using each value in <code>match_on</code> that says if that field matches the term show that otherwise show null. I then use MySQL's CONCAT_WS method to take each of the fields and combine them separated by a space and name it <code>matched_on</code>. Finally, I use a HAVING clause to filter out results that have a blank value for <code>matched_on</code>.<br /><br />I then use a simple map to set the accessor on the host with what was matched and return the hosts that were matched. <br /><br />I realize that this will only work with MySQL (probably), but since I am using it for development and production on this project that's not an issue, and it feels better than looping through the results again and setting <code>matched_on</code><br /><br />Thanks to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2260988/sql-mark-which-where-condition-matched/2261001#2261001">this answer</a> on Stack Overflow for pointing me in the right(?) direction.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7616842831210003750-2091183387924537947?l=random-rails.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
