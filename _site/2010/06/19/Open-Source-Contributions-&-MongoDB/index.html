    I recently attended <a href="http://railsconf.com/">RailsConf</a> 2010 in Baltimore and the 3 major takeaways I got form it were:<div><ul><li>The Rails community is awesome. I spent half of my time there just talking to other developers and found the experience to be as rewarding as any of the sessions. </li><li>Everyone was really pushing for more people to get involved in open source projects. There was a pretty heavy focus on "anyone can contribute."</li><li>MongoDB and other NoSQL solutions were all the rage. I tried to attend a few talks on it myself, since I was considering this for a project at work</li></ul><div>I am really going to try to push myself to write more here about what I've been working on. <a href="http://twitter.com/jnunemaker">John Nunemaker</a> made a point in his <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2010/public/schedule/detail/14323">presentation</a> that writing helps him decompress what he's learned.</div><div><br /></div><div>I am also going to try to push myself to contribute to more open source projects. Like I said, there was a big focus on this. The first day of the conference I randomly met up with <a href="http://github.com/drnic">Dr. Nic</a>, and without realizing who he was, asked him if he contributed to any open source projects. He did walk with me and gave me some insight that I shouldn't be afraid or intimidated to contribute. The <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2010/public/schedule/detail/14132">keynote</a> by <a href="http://www.yehudakatz.com/">Yehuda Katz</a> (who has been one of my heroes lately with not only his work on the Rails core, but his frequent updates to <a href="http://www.railsdispatch.com/">Rails Dispatch</a> and some other screencats he's put out there) also focused on how anyone can and should contribute. So, hopefully, in the very near future I'll have some stuff up on <a href="http://github.com/dpmcnevin">github</a> for people to take a look at.</div></div><div><br /></div><div>Lastly, I've been working with the stuff I learned from the presentations (<a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2010/public/schedule/detail/12005">here</a> and <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2010/public/schedule/detail/11245">here</a>), as well as the Birds of  a Feather session, where a small group of us sat and peppered John Nunemaker with questions about <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> and <a href="http://mongomapper.com/">MongoMapper</a>, which was very helpful.</div><div><br /></div><div>I've been working with both MongoMapper and <a href="http://mongoid.org/">Mongoid</a> and have found them to be both easy and powerful to use. I hope to have an app that's using it in production soon, but there's still more reading I have to do to optimize it.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7616842831210003750-7847190508475425781?l=random-rails.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
